Superphosphoric Acid (SPA) is a mineral acid containing phosphoric acid and several polyphosphoric acids. It contains 68% - 83% phosphorus pentoxide (30% - 36% P). It is usually used to produce ammonium polyphosphate, polyphosphate and liquid fertilizer. The characteristics of superphosphoric acid are: high content of phosphorus pentoxide, less corrosive than orthophosphoric acid, low freezing point, liquid at room temperature, significant supercooling characteristics, strong chelating ability to metal impurity ions, no sludge in storage and long-distance transportation. There are two production methods: hot method and wet method. The thermal method is to burn the element phosphorus, then oxidize and hydrate it. Wet process is made by concentrating wet process phosphoric acid and deep dehydration. Superphosphoric acid can be used to produce liquid fertilizer or suspension fertilizer with high nutritional components, and also can be used as catalyst and dehydrating agent in organic chemistry.
