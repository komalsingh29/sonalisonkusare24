Scandium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula SC (OH) 3 and has amphoteric properties. It is slightly soluble in water and exists in the form of SC (OH) 3 and a small amount of SC (OH) 2 + in saturated solution (pH = 7.85). The solubility is 0.0279 mol / L. it is transformed into SCO (OH) after aging, and the solubility is greatly reduced (0.0008 mol / L). Scandium hydroxide can be prepared by the reaction of scandium salt and hydroxide. In the process of reaction, there will also be intermediates of SC (OH) 1.75cl1.25, SC (OH) 2no3 and SC (OH) 2.32 (SO4) 0.34 produced according to different reaction raw materials.
