Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a class of lipids in which three saturated fats are bound to a glycerol backbone. What distinguishes MCTs from other triglycerides is the fact that each fat molecule is between six and twelve carbons in length. MCTs are a component of many foods, with coconut and palm oils being the dietary sources with the highest concentration of MCTs. MCTs are also available as a dietary supplement.
