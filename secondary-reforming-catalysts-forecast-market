There has been a rise in the demand for secondary reforming catalysts from petrochemical and fertilizer industries. Secondary reforming catalysts are metal oxides used for facilitating the reforming process. Reforming catalysts are generally made up of nickel and oxides of copper, zirconium, aluminum and nickel. A secondary reforming catalyst is primarily used in the reforming process in ammonia production. Secondary reforming catalysts find applications in processes such as methanol, ammonia, formaldehyde and syngas production. The activity of the secondary reforming catalyst decides the yield and conversion of feedstock. The use of a suitable catalyst in the reforming process is essential to the production output of the reforming plant. The performance of the catalyst is dependent on the reformer design.
